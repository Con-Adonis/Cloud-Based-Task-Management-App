# Cloud Task Manager
Cloud Task Manager is a cloud-based task management web application designed for group collaboration. The platform allows users to create, assign, and track tasks across devices, with a focus on productivity and clarity in team settings.

### Project Overview
This project was created as part of a course focused on developing full-stack web applications. The goal is to build a responsive and scalable task manager that supports real-time collaboration, cloud synchronization, and multi-user task delegation.

### Core Features
- View of daily tasks, categorized into incomplete and completed sections
- Support for marking tasks as important
- Task assignment to one or more users
- Project-based task filtering and organization
- Due date tracking with emphasis on tasks due today
- Ability to mark tasks as completed
- Persistent data across sessions and devices

The user interface includes a sidebar for navigation between views such as "My Day," "Important," and "Planned," along with filtering by specific projects. The task view emphasizes priority, due dates, and assignment transparency.

### Planned Technologies
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (framework to be determined)

Backend: Node.js with Express or an alternative backend framework

Database: MongoDB, Firebase, or Supabase (TBD)

Authentication and cloud sync: Firebase Auth or similar service
